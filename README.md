# osTicket - Ticket Lifecycle & Resolution

This lab demonstrates how I worked through the full lifecycle of tickets in osTicket — from user login and ticket creation to resolution. It gave me practical experience with how tickets are handled and resolved in a real-world IT support workflow.

### 🧑‍💼 Agent Assignment and View

Once tickets were submitted, they appeared in the agent's dashboard for triage and response. Here are examples of tickets being handled by Jane and John:

### ⏱ SLA Application

Each ticket was automatically assigned an SLA based on severity:
- **SEV-A**: Resolve within 1 hour  
- **SEV-B**: Resolve within 4 hours  
- **SEV-C**: Resolve within 8 hours

This helps prioritize high-impact issues first.

---

### ✅ Ticket Resolution

Once agents provided support, they marked tickets as resolved. Notes and responses were included in each ticket to communicate with the user and log the resolution.

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Practiced the full flow of a ticket in osTicket
- Learned how SLAs and help topics improve efficiency
- Experienced agent roles from both Jane and John’s perspectives
- Gained insight into working with teams, queues, and ticket resolution workflows

## 📌 Final Thoughts

This lab provided hands-on experience with a real-world ticketing workflow. By taking tickets from creation to resolution, I simulated exactly how IT support teams handle user requests, triage, escalation, and closure in a structured service desk system.
